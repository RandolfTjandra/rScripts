# rScripts

Collection of small utilities for Git workflows.

Each script lives in its own directory alongside a README that documents usage.

Directories:
- `gojira` - open Jira issues for the current branch
- `rebasepro` - interactive fixup and rebase helper
- `switchbranch` - choose from recent branches to check out
- `git_alias` - sample Git aliases for branch creation
- `pushcommit` - select a commit (relative to your root branch) and choose a branch to push it to
