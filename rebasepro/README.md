## ðŸš€ Usage

Note: This script does nothing when you don't have any staged changes.

The first time you use rebasepro, you'll be prompted to choose a feature branch 
to work against. You can either pick main or any branch that starts with "feature".

You'll then be prompted to pick a commit that you want your new changes to be applied to.

An interactive rebase with --autosquash will be launched assuming there are no additional
unstaged changes.
